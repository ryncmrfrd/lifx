# Lifx Web Controller :bulb:
A nice looking, easy to use Lifx controller for the web.

## Use
Just go [here](http://lifx.ryncmrfrd.me) and login using your auth code.
> You need one of these because LIFX won't let me use OAuth to login :concerned:. To get an auth token in your [Account Settings](https://cloud.lifx.com/settings).
It does actually work. Just trust me.
