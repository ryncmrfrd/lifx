# ðŸ’¡ Lifx Web Controller

> At LIFX, we don't make gadgets. We take light (a basic tool needed by people everywhere) and we make it life-changing. We make light that improves your health. Light that helps you work, and light that helps you play. Light for socialising, and light for me-time. A rainbow of color options, powerful automations, endless integrations all help our customers personalise their spaces so that they can do whatever it is that they do best. That's not a gadget, or a toy, or a gizmo â€“ that's smarter way of life... ex. It's pronounced LIFE-ex. - [LIFX About Page]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle](https://www.lifx.com/pages/about-us))
